<h1 class="intro">Introducing Codebreaker</h1>

<p>Codebreaker is a logic game in which a code-breaker tries to break a secret code created by a code-maker. The code-maker, which will be played by the application weâ€™re going to write, creates a secret code of four numbers between 1 and 6.</p>

<p>The code-breaker then gets some number of chances to break the code. In each turn, the code-breaker makes a guess of four numbers. The code-maker then marks the guess with up to four + and - signs.</p>

<p>A + indicates an exact match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code and in the same position.</p>

<p>A - indicates a number match: one of the numbers in the guess is the same as one of the numbers in the secret code but in a different position. </p>
